# Heat Equation with CUDA + MPI

## task

Implement the solution of the heat equation (five-point pattern) in a two-dimensional domain

Boundary conditions â€“ linear interpolation between the corners of the region. The value in the corners is 10, 20, 30, 20

Parameters (accuracy, grid size, number of iterations) must be set via command line parameters

The output of the program is the number of iterations and the achieved error value

Parallelization to multiple GPUs should be performed using MPI

The reduction operation (calculation of the maximum error) within a single MPI process is implemented using the CUB library

## compilation
